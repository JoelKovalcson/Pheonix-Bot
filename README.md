# Pheonix Bot

## Description

This is a Discord bot written using `Discord.js` designed to help administrate and manage a Discord server for the Warframe clan `The Pheonix Guards`. It uses Discord's more recent feature, Slash Commands, along with a robust permission system for each command that can be customized to the clan's preference.

This bot is intended for private user, but the code is public in case anyone is interested in seeing how it works.
